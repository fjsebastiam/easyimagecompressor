##  💡 Tips
Use the ✖ button on each image to remove it from the list.

Once compressed, a summary shows the total space saved.

The interface is fully responsive, and the top section is visually separated from the image gallery.

If the compression button is disabled, it will not show the "click" cursor, only once it's available.
